# Customer Behavior Data Analysis

# Overview
This project covers the end-to-end data analytics process — from raw data to insights.
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL queries using MySQL, and interactive dashboard creation in Power BI.
The goal is to understand customer behavior and identify patterns that support better business decisions.

# Dataset

File Name: customer_behavior.csv
Size: 3,900 rows × 18 columns
Format: CSV
Description: Contains customer details, purchase information, discounts, and region-wise transactions.
Objective: Find customer trends, top products, and sales performance.

# Tools & Technologies

Python (VS Code): Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Database: MySQL
Visualization: Power BI
Reporting: Gamma (summary & presentation)

#  Project Steps

Data Loading: Loaded CSV using Pandas in VS Code.
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and fixed data types.
EDA: Analyzed trends and created visual charts using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
SQL Queries: Imported cleaned data into MySQL and performed filtering, grouping, and joins for insights.
Dashboard: Built a Power BI dashboard showing key KPIs like top customers, total revenue, and regional sales.
Report: Created a summary and PPT presentation using Gamma.

# Results & Insights
